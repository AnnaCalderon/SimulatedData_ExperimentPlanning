# Simulated Experiemnt for Research 
## Overview
- Identified the optinal sample size for desired significance level and power
- Generated a realistic data set using simulation techniques for study design
- Created two scenarios: effect and no effect
- Analyzed the simulation data in both scenarios

## Background
- There is vast literature suggesting that incentive rewards motivate people to change health behaviors (Seal et al., 2003; Gong et al., 2018)
- A survey experiment by the U.C.L.A. suggests that approximately a third of the U.S. unvaccinated population reported they would be more likely to get the vaccine with a monetary incentive (New York Times, 2021)
- The literature also suggests that tailored interventions have the potential to improve health behavior (Krebs et al., 2010;McCurley et al., 2017)

## Research Problem 
Louisiana has the 4th lowest COVID-19 vaccine rate with only 42% of the adult population with at least one vaccine dose.
