# SimulatedData_ExperimentPlanning
## Overview
- Using a simulation study to plan an experiment 
- Generated a realistic data set using simulation techniques 
- Created two scenarios: one where the treatment has the expected effect and the other where the treatment does not
- Analyzed the data 
- Describe the results of this simulated analysis and the conclusions you would draw if the study produced data like what you simulated

## Background
- There is vast literature suggesting that incentive rewards motivate people to change health behaviors (Seal et al., 2003; Gong et al., 2018)
- A survey experiment by the U.C.L.A. suggests that approximately a third of the U.S. unvaccinated population reported they would be more likely to get the vaccine with a monetary incentive (New York Times, 2021)
- The literature also suggests that tailored interventions have the potential to improve health behavior (Krebs et al., 2010;McCurley et al., 2017)

## Research Problem 
Louisiana has the 4th lowest COVID-19 vaccine rate with only 42% of the adult population with at least one vaccine dose.
